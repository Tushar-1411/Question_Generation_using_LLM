            "* **Versatile:** Python can be used for a wide variety of tasks, including web development, data science, and machine learning. This versatility makes it a good choice for developers who want to work in a variety of fields.\n",
            "* **Open source:** Python is an open source language, which means that it is free to use and modify. This can be a major advantage for developers who want to be able to customize the language to their specific needs.\n",

Clients typically pay a monthly or annual service fee to providers, to gain \\naccess to systems that deliver software as a service, platforms as a service and infrastructure as a \\nservice to subscribers . Cloud Computing is the delivery of computing services such as servers, \\nstorage, databases, networking, software, analytics, intelligence, and more, over the Cloud.  \\n \\nA Brief History of Cloud Computing  \\nWhen we think of the cloud, rarely do we cast our minds back to times before the 21stcentury. \\nAfter all, it’s really just been over the past decade or so that cloud computing really started to \\ndevelop into the giant, omnipresent and all -powerful behemoth we know today. But the truth is \\nthat concepts of the cloud have existed for many, many years, and in fact can be traced as far back \\nas the 1950s with mainframe computing. In those early days, mainframe computers were huge \\nmachines, and very, very expensive – too expensive to buy and maintain one for  every single \\nemployee. And of course, not every single employee needed access to one at all times like they  do \\ntoday.  As such,  most  organizations  would  purchase  just one or two machines,  and then'"
